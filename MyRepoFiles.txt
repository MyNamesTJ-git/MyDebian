##### Apt repos | Access repo list via "sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list"

# HOW TO MODIFY AND INSTALL PACKAGES FROM DIFFERENT RELEASES:
# By default, the system installs from Bookworm (Stable) unless configured otherwise.
# To modify access to Testing (Trixie) repositories:
# 1. Uncomment the desired repository lines by removing the '#' at the beginning.
# 2. Use the "-t" flag with apt to install packages specifically from Trixie.

# Examples:
# - Install from Trixie (Testing):
#   sudo apt install -t trixie <package-name>
# - Install from Bookworm (Stable):
#   sudo apt install -t bookworm <package-name>
# - Use "apt policy <package-name>" to check available versions across releases.

# Notes:
# - Always back up your sources.list before making changes.
# - Keep Testing (Trixie) sources commented unless needed, as they may introduce instability.
